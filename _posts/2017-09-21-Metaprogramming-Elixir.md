I haven't read technical books for a while. Indeed, it was a little exciting to open a programming book after a long list of historical and political ones.

But I did it!

I picked a book related to the Metaprogramming in Elixir because I'm facing problems with grasping Elixir metaprogramming too often. I'm the author of 2 Elixir libraries which intensively use metaprogramming [[1]](https://github.com/asiniy/ecto_state_machine), [[2]](https://github.com/asiniy/ecto_materialized_path) plus one of my projects has Elixir API inside so I'm sure need to know how to metaprogram in Elixir.

[C. McCord](https://pragprog.com/book/cmelixir/metaprogramming-elixir)'s gave me a lot of context on internal Elixir mechanisms so it's definitely worth to read. I wouldn't recite all its details to you but it gave me a lot of answers on my `how?` questions.

My VERDICT: if you want to bring your Elixir to the next level READ THIS BOOK
