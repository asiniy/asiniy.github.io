This is the second book in the series. I found it helpful. In just 93 pages, "Scope & Closures" deeply covers annoying and "I don't want to think about that" concepts of javascript.

My takeaways:

* Better understanding of variable accessibility, and not for the javascipt only (I opened relative ruby articles immediately after I finished reading about the scope in javascript).
* Deeper view at hoisting. I don't even know how it will help me to develop better applications (declaration before invocation is always a good thing!).
* Closures - I got it!
* My key takeaway - impressive JS module "magic" was revealed and became obvious and ordinary to me.

In my opinion this book is worth reading. I will read next title following month.
